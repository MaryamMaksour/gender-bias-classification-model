Advancing AI and Machine Learning Solutions to Classify and Mitigate Gender Bias Across Texts for a More Equitable Future.
this is a my solution for Datathon with HerWill on Kaggle

## Overview
The overall objective of the competition is to advance the development of machine learning and deep learning models that can more accurately and efficiently classify gender bias in text. With a robust gender bias classification model, we can address gender bias, particularly against males, females and non-binary individuals in various contexts. Such a competition can give rise to new perspectives and conversations in the social science, gender studies and data science community.
